## 1. Executive Summary & Product Branding

The **DEAP Agent Orchestration Harness (`DEAP-Harness`)**, powered by the **DEAP-Seek Agent Engine**, establishes a unified, open-source, air-gapped agentic orchestration framework for the Digital Engineering Agent Platform (DEAP). 

By deeply embedding DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1 for long Chain-of-Thought reasoning and DeepSeek-V3/Coder for tool invocation and code generation) into DEAP, `DEAP-Harness` ties **Pipeline 0 (Pre-Spec Safety Engineering)**, **Pipeline 1 (Agile Backlog Projection)**, and **Pipeline 2 (TDD Code Synthesis)** into an end-to-end, autonomous, self-hosted engineering pipeline.

## 2. Core Architectural Objectives

1. **Air-Gapped & Off-Grid Defense Operations**:
   Enable aerospace, defense, and urban air mobility (UAM) organizations operating under DO-178C / DO-254 or SORA SAIL High-Risk categories to execute complete DEAP pipelines in 100% air-gapped, classified labs without transmitting proprietary flight control laws, CONOPS, or safety statecharts to cloud LLM endpoints.

2. **Deterministic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Safety Audit Evidence**:
   Automatically capture and archive raw DeepSeek-R1 reasoning traces (`<think>...</think>`) into `.pipeline/diagnostics/cot_audit_log.json`. Every safety constraint ($SC-1..N$), System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) Unsafe Control Action ($UCA-1..N$), and Run-Time Assurance (RTA) switching threshold is backed by immutable, traceable LLM reasoning evidence for FAA/EASA regulatory reviews.

3. **Autonomous End-to-End Pipeline State Machine**:
   Eliminate manual human context-switching between pipeline stages. `DEAP-Harness` orchestrates the handoff from Pipeline 0 (SysML v2 textual model and `pipeline0_handoff_contract.json`) to Pipeline 1 (Agile backlog generation) and Pipeline 2 (serial subagent RED-GREEN TDD code synthesis) with automated quality gate enforcement (`verify_model_coverage.py`, `verify_downstream_baseline.py`).

## 3. System Architecture & Component Topology

`DEAP-Harness` is structured into four primary subsystem modules:

    CLI["DEAP-Harness CLI\n(deap-harness run)"] --> ConfigLoader["Configuration & Profile Loader\n(deap_harness_config.yaml)"]
    ConfigLoader --> ProviderManager["Inference Provider Manager\n(vLLM / SGLang / Ollama / Local API)"]
    ProviderManager --> DualEngine["Dual-LLM Engine\n(DeepSeek-R1 CoT + DeepSeek-V3 Tools)"]
    DualEngine --> SubagentDispatcher["Context-Isolated Subagent Dispatcher"]
    SubagentDispatcher --> GateEnforcer["Constitutional Quality Gate Enforcer"]
```

### 3.1 Dual-LLM Inference Pattern (DeepSeek-R1 + DeepSeek-V3)

`DEAP-Harness` employs a **Dual-LLM Orchestration Pattern** to maximize reasoning depth while maintaining high-speed tool calling and JSON generation:

* **Reasoning Phase (DeepSeek-R1)**:
  For complex safety engineering tasks (STPA hazard identification, SORA SAIL risk classification, SysML v2 statechart formalization), the harness routes the prompt to DeepSeek-R1. The engine extracts and logs the `<think>...</think>` block to the regulatory audit store.
* **Execution & Tool Invocation Phase (DeepSeek-V3 / Coder)**:
  The harness feeds the finalized reasoning state into DeepSeek-V3/Coder to generate valid AST JSON contracts, format Mermaid class diagrams, write clean Python/C++ code, and execute shell tools cleanly.
