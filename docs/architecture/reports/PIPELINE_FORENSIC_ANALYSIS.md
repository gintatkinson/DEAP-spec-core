# Forensic Analysis Report: Specification Content Density Gaps & Root Causes

This report compiles the exhaustive findings from the three specialized sub-agents dispatched to audit the digital pipeline's schema extraction, behavioral modeling, use case engineering, and validation scripts. It identifies the root causes of why the generated specifications (like those in `digipipe-tst14`) are missing mandated content, and details the exact fixes required.

---

## 1. Feature & Schema Extraction Gaps
*Audited by: Pipeline Schema & Feature Extractor Auditor*

### Root Cause 1: Lack of Parent-Child Nesting Mandate in UML Class Diagrams
* **Observation**: In `feat-06-rateOfChange-vector.md` and other features, Class Diagrams show isolated classes (e.g. `rateOfChange` or `GeometrySystem` in `feat-02`) with no relationships.
* **Why**: The Class Diagram template and guidelines in [schema-specification-engineering/SKILL.md](../../../skills/schema-specification-engineering/SKILL.md) only instruct translating the immediate container class. They do not explicitly require showing parent-child composition (e.g. `geo-location *-- rateOfChange`) or cross-container associations (e.g. `rateOfChange`'s dependency on `reference-frame`).
* **Fix**: Update the `SKILL.md` UML Class Diagram guidelines to explicitly mandate that the diagram **must** show the class's nesting relationship to its parent container (up to the root container) and any dependencies on other containers.

### Root Cause 2: Underspecified "Test Data Shape"
* **Observation**: Functional UI Requirements sections lack concrete data representations and only provide simple text lists of types.
* **Why**: While the skill demands a "test data shape," the template does not provide an explicit markdown placeholder or code block example showing a JSON/YAML schema payload.
* **Fix**: Add a concrete JSON example block under `## Functional UI Requirements` to define "Test Data Shape".

### Root Cause 3: Vague Presentation Guidelines
* **Observation**: Presentation requirements are minimal (e.g., "Display coordinates").
* **Why**: The constraint *"without specifying framework-specific components"* is over-generalized by LLMs, leading them to strip out all visual layout details. The skill lacks instructions on detailing platform-independent logical arrangements.
* **Fix**: Revise the prompt guidelines to explicitly require a logical arrangement/layout description (e.g., "Group coordinates together in a 2-column details card; display accuracy bounds below the main coordinates").

---

## 2. Behavioral Story Modeling Gaps
*Audited by: Pipeline Behavioral Story Auditor*

### Root Cause 1: Shallow Sequence Diagrams
* **Observation**: UML Sequence Diagrams in User Stories show generic calls (e.g. `LocationProvider -> LocationRegistry -> VelocityTracker`) and do not model internal calculations, data storage flows, or validation checks.
* **Why**: [spec-user-story-engineering/SKILL.md](../../../skills/spec-user-story-engineering/SKILL.md) only mandates "dynamic interaction between the Actor and specific Domain Objects." It does not explicitly demand showing validation gates (e.g. calling a validator class), calculation blocks (e.g. calling a math utility helper), or details like parameters and return types.
* **Fix**: Update the sequence diagram requirements to explicitly show validation checks (calling a validator helper/service), business logic calculations, and parameters/returns.

### Root Cause 2: Missing Stories for Algorithmic & Derived States
* **Observation**: There is no User Story covering the derivation/calculation of rateOfChange and heading, even though it is a prominent part of Epic 3.
* **Why**: The story skill only instructs extracting "distinct deployment scenarios" from operational chapters. Mathematical derivations are typically defined in separate technical/algorithmic sections of normative specifications, which the sub-agent skips. There is no behavioral story trigger for derived/calculated values.
* **Fix**: Introduce an **Algorithmic Story Extraction Trigger** to force story generation for derived/calculated values.

---

## 3. Use Case & Traceability Gaps
*Audited by: Pipeline Use Case & Traceability Auditor*

### Root Cause 1: Title-Only and State-Open-Only GitHub Queries in the Skill File
* **Observation**: Use Case `uc-02-derive-rateOfChange-and-heading.md` links to User Story `us-04-track-rateOfChange-vector.md` in its realization matrix, but `us-04` contains no logic for rateOfChange and heading calculation.
* **Why**:
  1. In [spec-usecase-engineering/SKILL.md](../../../skills/spec-usecase-engineering/SKILL.md) (Step 3), the agent is instructed to run `gh issue list --label "user-story" --state "open" --json number,title`. This only fetches the `number` and `title` of User Stories, forcing it to make matches based purely on lexical similarity of titles.
  2. The `--state "open"` filter prevents the agent from finding or linking to any User Stories that have already been closed/completed, even if they are the correct implementations. This leads to artificial matches where the agent maps to whichever open issues happen to be left in the queue.
* **Fix**: 
  - Change the query in Step 3.1 to include both open and closed issues: `gh issue list --label "user-story" --state "all" --json number,title,body`.
  - Explicitly instruct the agent to inspect the content/scenarios of the User Stories to perform semantic mapping rather than name-only matches.
  - Require the agent to add a brief semantic justification to each checkbox link in the matrix (e.g., `- [ ] #41 - [User Story Title](https://github.com/example/url) - Implements Basic Flow Step 3: Validator Check`).

### Root Cause 2: Insufficient Template Granularity for Alternate/Exception Flows
* **Observation**: Alternate/exception flows in use cases are thin, single-line summaries.
* **Why**: The markdown template in `spec-usecase-engineering/SKILL.md` (Step 4) defines Alternate/Exception flows with only single-line placeholder steps. LLMs rely heavily on the structure and granularity of templates/examples. Providing single-step placeholders acts as an implicit guideline that single-sentence flows are acceptable.
* **Fix**: 
  - Update the template in Step 4 to show detailed, multi-step flows that branch from the Main Success Scenario.
  - Add explicit guidelines in Step 2.5: "Each alternate flow MUST start by identifying the branching point step from the Main Success Scenario, contain at least 2 numbered steps of system/actor interaction, and clearly state the resulting system state or rollback behavior."

### Root Cause 3: Inadequate Verification Linter Gates
* **Observation**: The `verify_model_coverage.py` linter passed successfully despite these severe content gaps.
* **Why**: The linter checks only the *existence* of headers and diagram blocks using simple regular expressions. It does not perform any validation on the main success scenario steps, alternate flows (nor the 2-flow minimum or step count), postconditions, or the realization matrix checkboxes.
* **Fix**:
  - Add structural markdown parsing for use cases to assert the presence of all standard Use Case sections.
  - Validate that Use Cases contain at least two alternate/exception flows, each with a numbered list of at least 2 steps.
  - Verify that the realization matrix contains at least one User Story checkbox and at least one Feature checkbox, using absolute URLs.

### Root Cause 4: Silent Treatment of Hallucinated/Fake Issues in Reconciler
* **Observation**: Hallucinated issue numbers can persist in the codebase.
* **Why**: In `reconcile_backlog.py` (`update_checklist_in_file`), when an issue ID from the matrix is not found in the GitHub registry (e.g. returns `None`), it is silently ignored. It is treated like an open issue, allowing hallucinated issue numbers to persist.
* **Fix**: Modify `update_checklist_in_file` to validate that every issue number found in a checklist actually exists. If it does not, raise an error and exit with a non-zero code.

+For every distinct deployment scenario and behavioral trigger found, model it as a formal User Story integrated with OOA/OOD principles.
+
+### Behavioral Extraction Triggers (Mandatory User Stories)
+An agent MUST extract a separate, dedicated User Story if the normative text or structural schema meets any of the following triggers:
+- **Algorithmic/Calculation Trigger**: If the specification or schema defines any mathematical formula, equation, conversion, or derivation (e.g., deriving rateOfChange and heading from a rateOfChange vector), it MUST have a dedicated User Story mapping the calculation behavior.
+  - Story format: `As a [System/Actor], I need to calculate [Derived Value] from [Input Values] using [Formula] so that [Outcome].`
+  - BDD scenarios must cover edge cases, rounding, division by zero, and invalid inputs.
+- **Temporal/State Lifecycle Trigger**: If the schema defines temporal attributes (`timestamp`, `valid-until`) or implies state-decay lifecycles, it MUST have a dedicated User Story detailing the transition to expired/stale state and postconditions for stale data access.
+
+### Story Modeling Guidelines
 1. Identify the Actor/Role (the object or entity initiating the action).
 2. Formulate the core scenario using strict BDD syntax mapped to object interactions:
    - `Given` (Precondition object state)
    - `When` (Triggering message or event)
    - `Then` (Postcondition object state)
    - Or standard format: `As an [Actor], I need to [Action/Message] so that [Outcome/State Change].`
 3. Map the story to specific Domain Objects (the structural schema entities affected).
-4. **UML Sequence Diagram:** Every User Story MUST include a **UML Sequence Diagram** (using Mermaid `sequenceDiagram`) illustrating the dynamic interaction between the Actor and specific Domain Objects (e.g. `domainRegistry`, `businessLogicService`), showing method signatures with camelCase parameters (matching the structural schema leaves) and return types/statuses. Naming actor participants as `Actor` is prohibited; use descriptive names (e.g., `clientActor`).
+4. **UML Sequence Diagram:** Every User Story MUST include a detailed **UML Sequence Diagram** (using Mermaid `sequenceDiagram`) illustrating the dynamic interaction between the Actor, Domain Objects, and calculation/validation helpers.
+   - **No Generic Actors**: Naming actor participants as `Actor` is prohibited; use descriptive names (e.g., `clientActor`).
+   - **Typed Method Signatures**: Show method signatures with explicit camelCase parameters, each annotated with its type matching the schema definition (e.g., `operationName(attributeName: DataType)`).
+   - **Typed Return Signatures**: Show explicit return types or object structures returned on the dashed lines (e.g., `ResponseObject(status: StatusType)`).
+   - **Validation Loops**: Model validation loops and conditional logic using Mermaid `alt`/`else` or `opt` blocks, showing both success and validation failure/error execution paths.
+   - **Computation Delegation**: Complex logic, calculations, or validations MUST be delegated to dedicated validator/calculator utility classes (e.g., `BusinessLogicService`, `ValidatorHelper`) and shown explicitly as nested calls (e.g., `domainRegistry ->> businessLogicService: validateBounds(...)`).
