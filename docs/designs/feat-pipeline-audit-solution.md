# Walkthrough: Dynamic Schema Parsing, Config-Driven Behavioral Triggers, and Protocol-Agnostic Governance

This walkthrough details the changes made to generalize the digital systems engineering pipeline's specification templates, linter validation gates, and constitution initialization logic, ensuring that the pipeline dynamically processes any schema or standard at runtime instead of hardcoding assumptions for YANG or IETF RFCs.

---

## 1. Code Changes

### Phase 1: Preparation
*   **behavioral_triggers.json**: Created [behavioral_triggers.json](../../rules/behavioral_triggers.json) to decouple the linter checks for rateOfChange and temporal calculations from python script execution, defining them dynamically as configuration rules.

### Phase 2: Model Coverage Script Refactoring
*   **verify_model_coverage.py**: 
    *   Implemented `parse_schema_file(filepath)` to route schema node extraction by file extension (`.yang` matched natively, with placeholders/stubs for OpenAPI and Protobuf).
    *   Added `load_behavioral_triggers` to dynamically read JSON rules from `rules/behavioral_triggers.json` (falling back to schema or script directories).
    *   Replaced hardcoded check loops inside `main` with a generic trigger evaluator that runs matches against the loaded rule definitions.
    *   Allowed directory resolution using `SCHEMA_DIR` instead of strictly checking for a `yang` directory.

### Phase 3: Project Constitution Update
*   **project-constitution SKILL.md**: 
    *   Updated the `project-constitution` initialization instructions to remove YANG/RFC-specific requirements from Step 2 and Step 3, keeping the initialized constitution file generic and protocol-agnostic.

### Phase 4: Generalize Spec Skill Templates
*   **schema-specification-engineering SKILL.md**: Generalized the `## 4. Source References` template format block to output `Structural Schema:` and `Normative Specification:` headers.
*   **spec-user-story-engineering SKILL.md**: Generalized template references to use dynamic placeholders instead of hardcoded YANG and IETF RFC URLs.
*   **spec-usecase-engineering SKILL.md**: Generalized template references to use dynamic placeholders instead of hardcoded YANG and IETF RFC URLs.

## 2. Verification

### Compiler Verification
*   Executed compilation checks: `python3 -m py_compile skills/spec-orchestrator/scripts/verify_model_coverage.py skills/spec-orchestrator/scripts/reconcile_backlog.py` resulting in **0 compiler errors**.
