"""Aggregate symptoms across multiple downstream workspaces (issue #301).

The working model for this pipeline is: run it against several downstream projects, read
the symptoms in their output, and isolate the shared upstream cause. Downstream content is
a diagnostic instrument and is discarded.

``verify_downstream_baseline.py`` answers *"is this one workspace healthy"*. This answers
*"what does this corpus of workspaces tell me about the pipeline"*, which is a different
question and the one that distinguishes a pipeline defect from a local accident.

**Breadth is the signal.** A symptom present in 5 of 5 workspaces is almost certainly an
upstream defect. One present in 1 of 5 is probably local to that project. Ranking by breadth
rather than by raw count keeps a single workspace with 200 instances of one rule from
drowning out a rule that quietly appears everywhere.

The strongest evidence in the audit that motivated this issue came from recurrence: seven
separate issues turned out to be one defect class, but that only became visible after the
seventh, and only because one reader happened to hold all seven in mind at once.
