# Use Case: Shared Cloud Sync via Remote Firestore Flow

## Parent Epic
- [x] #43 - Standalone Persistence Epic (https://github.com/gintatkinson/digital-pipeline-repo/blob/main/docs/epics/epic-43-downstream-delivery.md) (Aggregates all persistence layers and adapters for React and Flutter desktop configurations)

## 1. Actors
- **Primary Actor:** Operator/Engineer
- **Secondary Actors:** Firestore REST API

## 2. Preconditions
- Workstation has active network connection.
- App is configured with valid Firebase project credentials/API keys.

## 3. Trigger
Operator opens the collaborative monitor console or performs updates.

## 4. Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)
1. UI connects to production Firestore database using `FirestoreRepositoryAdapter`.
2. Adapter establishes listener stream to remote collections (`properties`).
3. Operator edits node coordinates/properties.
4. `FirestoreRepositoryAdapter` sends REST/gRPC write request to Firestore REST API.
5. Firestore database processes update and broadcasts change to all active monitors.
6. Collaborative consoles receive change notification and repaint the canvas.

## 5. Alternate and Exception Flows
- **5a. Network Drop / Connection Lost (Branches from Basic Flow step 4):**
  1. `FirestoreRepositoryAdapter` detects network connection loss.
  2. System falls back to offline cache, queues the write locally, and warns operator of offline state.
- **5b. Security Rule Violation (Branches from Basic Flow step 4):**
  1. Firestore REST API rejects write due to permission/security rule failure.
  2. System aborts write, clears queued change, notifies operator of authorization failure, and rolls back UI state.
- **5c. Data Model Schema Constraint Violation (Branches from Basic Flow step 4):**
  1. Firestore REST API or local adapter schema validation detects coordinate or property out-of-bounds error.
  2. System rejects write, displays constraint error message to the operator, and reverts UI inputs to the last valid state.

## 6. Postconditions (Guarantees)
- **Success Guarantee:** Node properties are successfully persisted in the remote cloud database, and all active collaborator consoles are updated and repainted in real-time.
- **Failure Guarantee:** Any failed write transaction is aborted, the UI state is rolled back to prevent visual drift, the operator is notified of the specific error, and the database integrity is maintained.

    Transmitting --> SchemaConstraintError : "Schema Validation Fail [Coordinates Out-Of-Bounds]"
    SchemaConstraintError --> ListeningToRemote : "Display Error / Revert UI State"
```

## 7. Operational Context
```
The React baseline (web_react) acts as the web-based console interface. It supports two primary deployment profiles:
Configuration B: Production Mode (Cloud Firestore)
- Target Environment: Live hosted environments (Firebase App Hosting or Google Cloud Run).
- Mechanism:
  - Connects to the live Google Cloud Firestore production instance over HTTPS/WSS.
  - Enforces strict read/write security rules (checking user authentication tokens) and encrypts all telemetry data in transit.
```

## 8. Realization Matrix

| Scenario / Flow | Code Symbol | Target Source File |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Main Success Scenario | `FirebaseDataSource.syncCloudProperties` | `app_flutter/lib/domain/data_sources/firebase_data_source.dart` |
| Exception 5a (Network Timeout) | `FirebaseDataSource.retryCloudSync` | `app_flutter/lib/domain/data_sources/firebase_data_source.dart` |
| Exception 5b (IAM Authorization Failure) | `FirebaseDataSource.handleAuthError` | `app_flutter/lib/domain/data_sources/firebase_data_source.dart` |

### Required User Stories
- [x] #3 - Collaborative Console Updates ([us-03-collaborative-sync](docs/user-stories/us-03-collaborative-sync.md)) (Verifies that operator actions are real-time broadcasted to other connected clients)
### Required Features
- [x] #44 - Downstream Baseline Seeding and Compliance Framework ([feat-44-downstream-baseline](docs/features/feat-44-downstream-baseline.md)) (Verifies concrete FirestoreRepositoryAdapter and compliance verification checks)
