# Feature: Execution Agent Auto-Bug-Filing Interface

## Parent Epic
- [ ] #[EpicID] - [Epic Title](../epics/epic-XX-name.md) (semantic linkage justification)

## Description
To prevent execution agents from halting silently without reporting bugs, this feature updates downstream agent coordinator instructions to automatically parse diagnostic payloads and submit them as upstream issues.

## UML Class Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AgentSubsystem {
        +ExecutionAgent agent [1]
    }
    class ExecutionAgent {
        +String downstreamRepoUrl [1]
        +String activeBranch [1]
        +Boolean allowUpstreamReporting [1]
        +Boolean[1] detectDiagnosticPayload(DiagnosticPayload payload)
        +void fileUpstreamBug(String payloadFile)
    }
    AgentSubsystem *-- ExecutionAgent
```

## Interface Requirements
### 1. Payload Schema
- The agent reads `.pipeline/diagnostics/repro_payload_[timestamp].json`.
- The agent executes `gh issue create` using the payload file.

### 3. Logical Operations & Interface Messages
1. A pipeline command fails downstream.
2. The execution agent captures the non-zero exit code.
3. The agent checks if `allow_upstream_reporting` is enabled.
4. The agent searches for the latest file under `.pipeline/diagnostics/`.
5. The agent executes `gh issue create --repo gintatkinson/digital-pipeline-repo --title "Tooling Bug: [Command] failed" --body-file [payload_path] --label "bug"`.

### 4. Logical Exception States & Validation Failures
1. If the downstream agent does not have GitHub CLI authorization, it prints the manual `gh issue create` command to the screen and fails.
